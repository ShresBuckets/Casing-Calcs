# Casing-Calcs
Program to quickly determine safety factors for non-negligible stresses in Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) casings (closure calculations apply solely to aft closures due to failure mode hierarchies).

Note that the default YTS and Bearing Stress values are based off of Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6 and would need to be updated depending on casing/closure material choices.
